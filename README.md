# rlc_simulation_example
A simple simulation example for RC and RLC circuit step response, in Python code.
This is by no means a rigorous mathematical treatment, but more of an example for simulation in Python using basics.
(A more authentic analysis can be done with package lcapy).
The equation derivation is attached as pdf.
